TermX is an interactive, web-based simulator that emulates the look and feel of a macOS terminal and file explorer. It's a fun and practical project designed to showcase a modern, dynamic web application that operates a virtual file system directly in your browser.

This project is perfect for anyone interested in exploring command-line interfaces, file management, or just wants to play around with a virtual environment without touching their actual computer.
