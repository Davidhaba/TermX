TermX: A Web-Based macOS Terminal and File System Simulator
TermX is an interactive, web-based simulator that emulates the look and feel of a macOS terminal and file explorer. It's a fun and practical project designed to showcase a modern, dynamic web application that operates a virtual file system directly in your browser. This project is perfect for anyone interested in exploring command-line interfaces, file management, or just wants to play around with a virtual environment without touching their actual computer.
Features
TermX provides a robust set of features that mimic a real operating system environment, all within your web browser.
Interactive Terminal
The core of TermX is its fully functional terminal. You can run classic Unix-like commands to navigate the file system and manage files:
 * ls: List all files and directories in the current path.
 * cd: Change the current directory to navigate through folders.
 * mkdir: Create new directories.
 * touch: Create new, empty files.
 * cat: Display the content of a text file.
 * echo: Print text to the terminal.
 * rm: Delete files and folders.
 * mv: Move or rename files and folders.
 * clear: Clear the terminal screen.
 * download: Download files from a specified URL directly into the virtual file system.
The terminal also includes an help command to give you a quick overview of each command's functionality.
File Explorer
In addition to the terminal, TermX features a graphical file explorer that makes navigation intuitive and simple. The explorer allows you to:
 * View Files: See all files and folders in a visual, user-friendly interface.
 * Navigate: Double-click on folders to enter them and use the back button to navigate to the parent directory.
 * Manage Files: Right-click on items to access a context menu with options to rename, delete, open, and view file properties.
 * Sorting: Sort files by name, type, or size with a single click.
Integrated Applications
TermX comes with several built-in applications that work seamlessly with the virtual file system:
 * Text Editor: A full-featured text editor for creating, editing, and saving text files. It supports keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+S to save and Ctrl+N for a new file.
 * Image Viewer: A simple image viewer that automatically opens and displays supported image files.
 * Video Player: A basic video player for viewing videos stored in the file system.
